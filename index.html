        <p>My name is Andrew Gallowitch and I am 26 years young. I was born in Chicago, IL and moved to Charlotte,
            NC shortly after with my family. I enjoy activities like snowboarding, hiking, surfing, and traveling. I never
            really thought about traveling as something that I enjoy till somewhat recently.</p>
        
        <p>The Summer of 2015 I had the
            chance to visit 5 different countries in Europe and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had. It was
            interesting to see and be a part of different cultures as I hope to see more of the world one day.</p>
        
        <p>Another major passion of mine is Soccer. This sport has been a huge part of my life. I have played
            for more than 20 years and was given the opportunity to play at the collegiate level. I must say, there was such
            a special feeling of putting on a kit, lacing up a pair of boots, walking out on a clean cut pitch under the
            lights and playing the beautiful game of soccer. Although I no longer play competitively I still enjoy being
            a spectator of the sport.</p>
