                    <p>My name is Andrew Gallowitch and I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development at UNCC coding
                        bootcamp. I have previously obtained my B.A. in Business and Organizational Leadership from Brevard
                        College finishing with a 3.5 gpa. I was able to do this all while working my way through college
                        and demonstrating what it takes to be a student athlete. After graduating, I started my career as
                        a data and marketing analyst where I worked with major retailers to maximize traffic and profits
                        as well as creating product content for our vendors. A few characteristics I have displayed in my
                        previous positions is a strong work ethic, the ability to juggle competing priorities successfully
                        and practicing creative problem-solving skills with other team members as well as independently.
                    </p>

                    <p>I was then exposed to web developement when I took a self-paced online front end developement course.
                        This sparked my interest in the world of Web Developement. Throughout my studies in the Full Stack
                        program, I have developed skills from building web applictions using multiple coding languages to
                        working with different server side libraries and tools. The most exciting thing about Web Developement
                        for is that YOU ARE ALWAYS LEARNING!!
                    </p>
